    "Case discussionThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly:\nThe fall and resolution of Banco Espírito Santo\n“We usually say that first comes the interest of our country, second, that of the institution and, only in third, that of shareholders”– Ricardo Espírito Santo Silva Salgado, CEO 1992-2014i\nOna hot Sunday night,August 3rd, the Portuguese central bank, Banco de Portugal (BdP), announced the resolution of BancoEspírito Santo (BES), which had fallen in disgrace after, a few days earlier, posting a €3.6bn loss in 2014Q2. The size of the losses consumed most of the existing capital base. Once the European Central Bank (ECB) made the decision to revoke BES's status as a counterparty for refinancing operations and requested that the bank paid back about €10 billion in ECB loans, BdP was forced to recognise BES' inability to make such repayment and put the bank under resolution.\nThe resolutioninvolved the separation of BES between a good and a bad bank. BES’ sound assets and most liabilities were transferred toa “transition bank”, or \"good bank\", which got fresh capital in the amount of €4.9bn from the Portuguese \"Bank Resolution Fund\". The century and half old BES was to be liquidated, keeping only those assets deemed “toxic” in its balance sheet. This \"bad bank\" also retained all liabilities to qualified shareholders, the bank's initial equity as well as BES' subordinated bonds. These were ugly news for those who had invested on thatsummer's BES rights issue. Or even those, including Goldman Sachs, who took long positions on the stock a few days before. How could the Espírito Santos(ES), the oldest banking dynasty of Portugal, have broughtthe bank to its knees?Espírito Santo: the originsii\nJosé Maria doEspírito Santo e Silva was born in Lisbon on 1850, to unknown parents. As was commonplace throughout Catholic societies, being an unwanted baby,he was dropped off at the door of the nearest convent. According to legend, he was actually the son of a nobleman and his father not only funded the boy’s education, but also provided a loan for him to kick-start his adult life. It is no legend that by 1869, aged 19 years, José Maria owned a small shop where he dealt in currency exchange and sold lottery tickets. Later he moved on to real estate investments, asset management and commercial banking.\nBy 1911, now a much respected and influent Lisbon banker, José Maria finally bought out the position of the only remaining associate in their commercial banking and securities trading firm. “Silva, Beirão, Pinto & Cia.” became “J.M. Espírito Santo Silva” – the first firmto bear his name. In 1915 his son José Ribeiro took charge of the business after his father’s unexpected death. In 1920, he oversaw a new transformation, as it became BancoEspírito Santo SARL. During World War I, the Portuguese economy struggled.With strong inflation,\nThis case study was prepared by Paulo Soares de Pinho.\nthe Escudo lost value very quickly, but the ES weathered the storm. In the early 1930’s the bank escaped relatively unscathed a serious banking crisis. The bank grew steadily, but after Ricardo, José Ribeiro’s younger brother, took over as leader, it really took off. In 1937, they merged with another bank, creating BancoEspírito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa(BESCL), who became the leading privately-owned bank in Portugal. Ricardo, by then, becamea close personal advisor to Oliveira Salazar, the sombre dictator who had just risen to power, and used his influence to grow the bank’s business.\nDuring World War II, Portugal maintained a “neutral” status, which made it a safe haven for Europe’s aristocracy and top businessmen to safeguard their assets and, often, their lives. Ricardo was not only a shrewd banker but also, with the help of his wife, Mary Cohen, a masterful hostess, welcomed to his home many aristocrats and industrialists seeking refuge in Portugal, including the Duke of Windsor. Ricardo, whom the allies suspected of pro- German tendencies, made the most of Portugal’s status, and during the war period, BESCL’s stock quadrupled in value.\nRicardo would eventually die young, in 1955, and was succeeded by abrother, Manuel RibeiroEspírito Santo, who would continue along the same tone, further developing international connections to wealthy families, such as the Rockefellers and Firestones, and to nobility, like the future King of Spain JuanCarlos and his father. In the 1960s, a golden era for the Portuguese economy dawned after its entrance in the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). BESCL continued to grow, beginning to channel cash into several different businesses, from textiles to oil and gas. Under the authoritarian regime of Salazar, most business decisions were in one way or another very conditioned by central government, and assets in all business fields were highly consolidated around a handful of large, well- connected conglomerates. For the large part, these were controlled by three traditional",
